# Multilingual-Translator-with-STT-TTS
This is a multilingual translator using Speech-to-text and Text-to-speech.

I used Google Cloud Speech API and Translation API.

So, you must have your own Google Cloud account with billing and those APIs. 

Also, I referenced some parts of the project by a Korean developer, Chandong83.
