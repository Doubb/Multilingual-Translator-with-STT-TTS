# Multilingual-Translator-with-STT-TTS
This is a multilingual translator using Speech-to-text and Text-to-speech.

I used Google Cloud Speech API and Translation API.

So, you must have your own Google Cloud account with billing and those APIs. 

Also, I referenced some parts of the project by a Korean developer, Chandong83.

# Usage

2. Run translation_stt_tts.py. 
If you ran correctly, you can hear "Translation enabled." in Korean and English.

3. Say "English to (A language what you want to translate)" to your computer's microphone.
Then, you can hear a sentence "Please say a sentence" in chosen language.

4. Say a word or sentence in chosen language.

5. This program will translate your saying and say it!
